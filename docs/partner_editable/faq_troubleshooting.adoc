*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance continues running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, review the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// Customize this answer if needed. For example, if you’re deploying on Linux instances, either provide the location for log files on Linux or omit the final sentence. If the Quick Start has no EC2 instances, revise accordingly (something like "and the assets keep running").

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* The DNS validation for the SSL certificate times out.

*A.* You might encounter this issue if your DNS provider is not Amazon Route 53. In this case, you must add DNS records to your DNS registrar for the routing to work. For more information, see the following pages:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html[Use DNS to Validate Domain Ownership^]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/how-domain-validation-works.html[How Domain Validation Works^]

*Q.* The DNS validation appears to have completed successfully, but the Quick Start errors out during the ACM certificate DNS step.

*A.* If you run into this issue: 

* If you already have a wildcard ACM certificate in the AWS Region where you deployed the Quick Start, you can skip the ACM certificate DNS step by supplying the ARN of your preexisting certificate in the `SSLCertificateARN` parameter. You can also import certificates in the ACM console and use the ARN of your uploaded certificate. 
* Alternatively, ensure that DNS validation is working by provisioning certificates outside the Quick Start by following the instructions in the links provided for the previous bullet point. Use the certificate you created in the `SSLCertificateARN` parameter to skip the ACM certificate DNS step.
