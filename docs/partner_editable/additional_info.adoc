2. Next, confirm that WordPress is installed correctly. Note down the application URL and navigate to ApplicationURL/wordpress/. Enter the requisite information, if you choose to set up the site.
3. Navigate to the AWS Config console. Here, you can see the status of your configuration. Note that AWS Config will monitor all resources in the AWS Region you deploy in, not just what is in this particular Quick Start. For example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume may not be encrypted elsewhere.
