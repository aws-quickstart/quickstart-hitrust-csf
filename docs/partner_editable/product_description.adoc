HITRUST CSF (Health Information Trust Alliance Common Security Framework) is a security framework that incorporates security requirements into existing frameworks that originate from global entities, such as the following:

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
* Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
* Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)
* Projects of Common Interest (PCI)
* Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT)
* National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
* Fair Trade Commission (FTC)
* Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

HITRUST developed the CSF Assurance Program, which comprises the requirements, methods, and tools that let organizations incrementally manage their compliance requirements. It also allows business partnerships and vendors to assess and report against multiple sets of requirements.

Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and its customers. This shared responsibility model can help lessen the customerâ€™s operational burden as AWS operates, manages, and controls the OS components and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates. AWS customers can design and implement an AWS environment and use AWS services in a manner that satisfies HITRUST CSF requirements. Customers can also use certain controls established under the HITRUST CSF validated assessment of AWS services.

AWS services have been assessed under the HITRUST CSF Assurance Program by an approved HITRUST CSF assessor to meet HITRUST CSF v9.1 certification criteria. The HITRUST CSF certification of AWS is valid for two years and can be accessed at https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/[https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/^].
